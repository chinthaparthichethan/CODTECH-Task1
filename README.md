Overview of the Project

Project: Simple Calculator using python
Objective
The Simple Calculator Program is a Python-based command-line application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It allows users to execute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and aims to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts like functions, user input handling, and error checking.

Key Activities
Function Implementation: Developed functions for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User Input Handling: Prompts users to input two numbers and select the desired arithmetic operation.
Error Handling: Includes validation for numeric input and manages division by zero errors.
Result Display: Outputs the result of the chosen operation or relevant error messages.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in creating command-line applications.
Core Concepts:
Functions: Encapsulate the logic for various arithmetic operations.
User Input Handling: Utilizes input() to gather data from users.
Error Handling: Implements try and except blocks for input validation and division by zero.
Conditional Statements: Manages user choices and directs the flow of operations.
Usage
Run the Program: Execute the script in a Python environment.
Enter Numbers: Input two numeric values when prompted.
Select Operation: Choose an operation by entering the number corresponding to:
1 for Addition
2 for Subtraction
3 for Multiplication
4 for Division
View Result: The result of the selected operation will be displayed.
